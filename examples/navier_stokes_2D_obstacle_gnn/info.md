# Navier-Stokes 2D Obstacle GNN

You can find nodes and edges from graph in the [Download Nodes and Edges Data](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/qXpZE-xZ4CJL4g)

After downloading, place the files in the appropriate directories:

- Place the `nodes.csv` file at `navier_stokes_2D_obstacle_gnn/data/nodes.csv`.
- Place the `edges.csv` file at `navier_stokes_2D_obstacle_gnn/data/edges.csv`.

Also, please read the `README.md` file to install the necessary dependencies for `torch-geometric`.
